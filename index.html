  <p>
Donggyu Lee is a research economist in Macroeconomic and Monetary Studies. His research interests include distributional consequences of conventional and unconventional monetary policies, implications of household heterogeneity on wage and employment determination in the labor market, interactions between household income distribution and firm dynamics, and the estimation of dynamic models with heterogeneous agents. His recent work focuses on the non-linear distributional effects of unconventional monetary policies and the adverse effect of rising income dispersion on small firm job creations. He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Maryland, College Park, M.A and B.A. in Economics from Seoul National University.
